<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>STONE PILLAR WORSHIP.</h3>

  <p>In Vol. v., p. 121. of "N. &amp; Q.," there is an interesting note on
  this subject by <span class="sc">Sir J. Emerson Tennent</span>, which he
  concludes by observing that "it would be an object of curious inquiry, if
  your correspondents could ascertain whether this (the superstitious
  veneration of the Irish people for such stones) be the last remnant of
  pillar worship now remaining in Europe." I am able to assure him that it
  is not. The province of Brittany, in France, is thickly studded with
  stone pillars, and the history and manners of its people teem with
  interesting and very curious traces of the worship of them. In fact,
  Brittany and Breton antiquities must form the principal field of study
  for any one who would investigate or treat the subject exhaustively.</p>

  <p>A list of the principal of these pillars still remaining may be found
  in the note at p. 77. of the first vol. of Manet's <i>Histoire de la
  Petite Bretagne</i>: St. Malo, 1834. But abundant notices of them will be
  met with in any of the numerous works on the antiquities and topography
  of the province. They are there known as "Menhirs," from the Celtic
  <i>maen</i>, stone, and <i>hirr</i>, long; or "Peulvans," from
  <i>peul</i>, pillar, and <i>maen</i> (changed in composition into
  <i>vaen</i>), stone. See <i>Essai sur les Antiquités du Département du
  Morbihan</i>, par J. Mahé, Vannes, 1825, where much curious information
  on the subject may be found. This writer, as well as the Chevalier de
  Freminville, in his <i>Monuments du Morbihan</i>, Brest, 1834, p. 16.,
  thinks that these menhirs, so abundant throughout Brittany, may be
  distinguished into three classes: 1. Those intended as sepulchral
  monuments; 2. Those erected as memorials of some great battle, or other
  such national event; and 3. Those intended to represent the Deity, and
  which were objects of worship. I have little doubt that these gentlemen
  are correct in the conclusions at which they have arrived in this
  respect. But it is curious to find both of them&mdash;men unquestionably
  of learning, and of widely extended and varied reading&mdash;considering
  the poems of Ossian as indisputably authentic, and quoting from them
  largely as from unquestioned documents of historic value.</p>

  <p>The largest "menhir" known to be in existence&mdash;if, indeed, it can
  still be said to be so&mdash;is that of Locmariaker, a commune of the
  department of Morbihan, a little to the south of Vannes. This vast stone,
  before it was thrown down and broken into four pieces&mdash;its present
  condition&mdash;was fifty-eight French feet in length. Its form, when
  entire, was that of a double cone, so that its largest diameter was at
  about the middle of its length. It has been calculated to weigh more than
  four hundred thousand French pounds. In its immediate neighbourhood is a
  very large specimen of the "Dolmens" or druidical altars on which victims
  were sacrificed.</p>

  <p>As to the question when the worship of these stones ceased, my own
  observations of the manners and habits of the people there, some fifteen
  years since, would lead me to say that it had not then ceased. No doubt
  such an assertion would be indignantly repelled by the clergy, and
  perhaps by many of the peasantry themselves. The question, however, if
  gone into, would become a subtle one, turning on another, as to what is
  to be deemed <i>worship</i>. And we all know that the tendency of
  unspiritual minds to idolatry has led the priesthood of Rome to institute
  verbal distinctions on this point, which open the door to very much that
  a plain unbiassed man must deem rank polytheism. My knowledge of the
  people in Italy enables me to affirm, with the most perfect certainty,
  that not only the peasantry very generally, but many persons much above
  that rank, do, to all intents and purposes, and in the fullest sense of
  the word, <i>worship</i> the Madonna, and believe that there are several
  separate and wholly distinct persons of that name. And that this worship
  is often as wholly Pagan in its nature as in its object, is curiously
  proved by the fact, which brings us back again to Brittany, that in many
  instances in that province we find chapels dedicated to "Notre Dame de la
  Joye," and "Notre Dame de Liesse," which are all built on spots where, as
  M. de Freminville says in his <i>Antiquités du Finisterre</i>, p. 106.,
  "the Celts worshipped a divinity which united the attributes of Cybele
  and Venus." And Souvestre, in his <i>Derniers Bretons</i>, vol. i. p.
  264., tells us that there still exists near the town of Tréguier, a
  chapel dedicated to Notre Dame de la Haine; that it would be a mistake to
  suppose that the people have ceased to believe in a deity of hate, and
  that persons may still be seen skulking thither to pray for the
  gratification of their hatred.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Sir J. Emerson Tennent</span> quotes a passage from
  Borlase, in which he says, speaking of this stone-worship among the
  Cornish, a people of near kin to the Armorican Bretons, that it might be
  traced by the prohibitions of councils through the fifth and sixth, and
  even into the seventh century. I find a council, held at Nantes in 658,
  ordering that the stones worshipped by the people shall be removed and
  put away in places where their worshippers cannot find them again; a
  precaution which the history of some of these stones in Brittany shows to
  have been by no means superfluous. But the usage may be traced by edicts
  seeking to restrain it to a later period than this. For in the
  <i>Capitulaires</i> of Charlemagne (Lib. x. tit. 64.), he commands that
  the abuse of worshipping stones shall be abolished.</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt, however, that this worship remained even
  avowedly to a very much more recent period in Brittany. "It is well
  known," <!-- Page 536 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page536"></a>{536}</span>says De Freminville, in his <i>Antiquités
  des Côtes-du-Nord</i>, p. 31., "that idolatry was still exercised in the
  Isle of Ushant, and in many parishes of the diocese of Vannes, in the
  seventeenth century. And even at the present day," he adds, "how many
  traces of it do we find in the superstitious beliefs of our
  peasants!"</p>

  <p>Many of these notions still so prevalent in the remoter districts of
  that remote province, seem to point to nearly obliterated indications of
  a connexion between these "peulvans" or pillar-stones, and the zodiacal
  forms of worship, which the Druids are known to have, more or less
  exoterically, practised. Thus it is believed in many localities that a
  "menhir" in the neighbourhood <i>turns on its axis at midnight</i>.
  (Mahé, <i>Essai sur les Antiq. du Morbihan</i>, p. 229.) In other cases
  the peasantry make a practice of specially visiting them on the eve of
  St. John, <i>i. e.</i> at the summer solstice.</p>

  <p>Various other remnants of the ideas or practices inculcated by the
  ancient faith may be traced in usages and superstitions still prevalent,
  and, without such a key to their explanation, meaningless. With such
  difficulty did the new supplant the old religion. Many curious
  illustrations may be found in Brittany of the means adopted by the
  priests of the new faith to steal, as it were, for their own emblems the
  adoration which all their efforts were ineffectual to turn from its
  ancient objects, in the manner mentioned by the writer in the
  <i>Archæologia</i>, cited by <span class="sc">Sir J. E. Tennent</span> in
  his Note. Thus we find "menhirs" with crosses erected on their summits,
  and sculptured on their sides. See <i>Notions Historiques, etc. sur le
  Littoral du Département des. Côtes-du-Nord</i>, par M. Habasque: St.
  Brieuc, 1834, vol. iii. p. 22.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, I may observe that this worship prevailed also in
  Spain&mdash;, doubtless, throughout Europe&mdash;inasmuch as we find the
  Eleventh and Twelfth Councils of Toledo warning those who offered worship
  to stones, that they were sacrificing, to devils.</p>

<h3>SOMERSETSHIRE FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p>1. All texts heard in a church to be remembered by the congregation,
  for they must be repeated at the day of judgment.</p>

  <p>2. If the clock strikes while the text is being given, a death may be
  expected in the parish.</p>

  <p>3. A death in the parish during the Christmas tyde, is a token of many
  deaths in the year. I remember such a circumstance being spoken of in a
  village of Somerset. Thirteen died in that year, a very unusual number.
  Very many attributed this great loss of life to the fact above
  stated.</p>

  <p>4. When a corpse is laid out, a plate of salt is laid on the chest.
  Why, I know not.</p>

  <p>5. None can die comfortably under the cross-beam of a house. I knew a
  man of whom it was said at his death, that after many hours hard dying,
  being removed from the position under the cross-beam, he departed
  peaceably. I cannot account for the origin of this saying.</p>

  <p>6. Ticks in the oak-beams of old houses, or death-watches so called,
  warn the inhabitants of that dwelling of some misfortune.</p>

  <p>7. Coffin-rings, when dug out of a grave, are worn to keep off the
  cramp.</p>

  <p>8. Water from the font is good for ague and rheumatism.</p>

  <p>9. No moon, in its change, ought to be seen through a window.</p>

  <p>10. Turn your money on hearing the first cuckoo.</p>

  <p>11. The cattle low and kneel on Christmas eve.</p>

  <p>12. Should a corpse be ever carried through any path, &amp;c., that
  path cannot be done away with. For cases, see Wales, Somerset, Bampton,
  Devon.</p>

  <p>13. On the highest mound of the hill above Weston-super-Mare, is a
  heap of stones, to which every fisherman in his daily walk to Sand Bay,
  Kewstoke, contributes one towards his day's good fishing.</p>

  <p>14. Smothering hydrophobic patients is still spoken of in Somerset as
  so practised.</p>

  <p>15. Origin of the saying "I'll send you to Jamaica." Did it not take
  its source from the unjudge-like sentence of Judge Jeffries to those who
  suffered without sufficient evidence, for their friendly disposition
  towards the Duke of Monmouth: "To be sent &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;
  to the plantations of Jamaica?" Many innocent persons were so cruelly
  treated in Somerset.</p>

  <p>16. The nurse who brings the infant to be baptized bestows upon the
  first person she meets on her way to the church whatever bread and cheese
  she can offer, <i>i. e.</i>, according to the condition of the
  parents.</p>

  <p>17. In Devonshire it is thought unlucky not to catch the first
  butterfly.</p>

  <p>18. Mackerel not in season till the lesson of the 23rd and 24th of
  Numbers is read in church. I cannot account for this saying. A better
  authority could have been laid down for the remembering of such like
  incidents. You may almost form a notion yourself without any help. The
  common saying is, Mackerel is in season when Balaam's ass speaks in
  church.</p>

<h3>DERIVATION OF CURIOUS BOTANIC NAMES, AND ANCIENT ITALIAN KALYDOR.</h3>

  <p>The generic name of the fern <i>Ceterach officinarum</i> is generally
  said to be derived from the Arabic <i>Chetherak</i>. I find however,
  among a list of ancient British names of plants, published in 1633 at the
  end of Johnson's edition of Gerard, the expression <i>cedor y wrach</i>,
  which means <i>the joined</i> or <i>double rake</i>, and is exactly
  significant of the form of the Ceterach. The Fernrakes are joined as it
  were back to back; but the single prongs of the one alternate botanically
  with those of the other. Master Robert Dauyes, of Guissaney in
  Flintshire, the correspondent of Johnson, gives the name of another of
  the Filices (<i>Equisetum</i>) as the English equivalent of the ancient
  British term. But the form of this plant does not at all correspond to
  that signified by the Celtic words. It is not improbable, therefore, that
  he was wrong as respects the correct English name of the plant.</p>

  <p>The Turkish <i>shetr</i> or <i>chetr</i>, to cut, and <i>warak</i>, a
  leaf, seem to point out the meaning of the Arabic term quoted in Hooker's
  <i>Flora</i> and elsewhere. Probably some of your Oriental readers will
  have the kindness to supply the exact English for <i>chetherak</i>.</p>

  <p>It appears to me, however, that the transition from <i>cedorwrach</i>
  to <i>ceterach</i> is more easy, and is a more probable derivation.</p>

  <p>Hooker and Loudon say that another generic name, <i>Veronica</i>, is
  of doubtful origin. In the Arabic language I find <i>virunika</i> as the
  name of a plant. This word is evidently composed of <i>nikoo</i>,
  beautiful, and <i>viroo</i>, remembrance; viroonika. therefore means
  beautiful remembrance, and is but an Oriental name for a Forget-me-not,
  for which flower the <i>Veronica chamædrys</i> has often been mistaken.
  Possibly the name may have come to us from the Spanish-Arabian
  vocabulary. The Spaniards call the same plant <i>veronica</i>. They use
  this word to signify the representation of our Saviour's face on a
  handkerchief. When Christ was bearing his cross, a young woman, the
  legend says, wiped his face with her handkerchief, which thenceforth
  retained the divine likeness.<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The feminine name <i>Veronica</i> is of course the Latin form of <span
  title="Pheronikê" class="grk"
  >&Phi;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&nu;&#x1F77;&kappa;&eta;</span>,
  victory-bearer (of which Berenice is the Macedonian and Latin
  construction), and is plainly, thus derived, inappropriate as the
  designation of a little azure wild flower which, like loving eyes, greets
  us everywhere.</p>

  <p>In looking over Martin Mathée's notes on <i>Dioscorides</i>, published
  1553, I find that Italian women of his time used to make a cosmetic of
  the root of the <i>Arum</i>, commonly called "Lords and Ladies." The
  mixture, he says, makes the skin wondrously <!-- Page 538 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page538"></a>{538}</span>white and shining, and
  is called <i>gersa</i>. ("<i>Ils font des racines d'Aron de l'eaue et de
  lexive</i>," &amp;c., tom. v. p. 98.)</p>

  written till April 29, 1621, when it is written "restiall," which
  continues to be its orthography until 1645, when it ceases to be used
  altogether, and "burials in the church" are alone spoken of.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>SEPULCHRAL MONUMENTS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(<i>Continued from</i> p. 514.)</p>

  <p>In a previous communication, fighting under the shield of a great
  authority, I attempted to prove that the effigies of the mediæval tombs
  presented the semblance of death&mdash;death in grandeur, mortality as
  the populace were accustomed to behold it, paraded in sad procession
  through the streets, and dignified in their temples. The character of the
  costume bears additional testimony to their supposed origin, and strongly
  warrants this conclusion. It is highly improbable that the statuaries of
  that age would clothe the expiring ecclesiastic in his sacerdotal robes,
  case the dying warrior in complete steel, and deck out other languishing
  mortals in their richest apparel, placing a lion or a dog, and such like
  crests or emblems, beneath their feet. They were far too matter-of-fact
  to treat a death-bed scene so poetically. The corpse however, when laid
  in state, <i>was</i> arrayed in the official or the worthiest dress, and
  these heraldic appurtenances <i>did</i> occupy that situation. Thus in
  1852 were the veritable remains of Prince Paul of Wurtemburg, in full
  regimentals and decorated with honours, publicly exhibited in the
  Chapelle Ardente at Paris (<i>Illustrated London News</i>, vol. xx. p.
  316.). Unimaginative critics exclaim loudly against the anomaly of a
  lifeless body, or a dying Christian, being thus dressed in finery, or
  covered with cumbrous armour; and such would have been the case in former
  days had not the people been so familiarised with this solemn spectacle.
  In an illumination in Froissart we have the funeral of Richard II., where
  the body is placed upon a simple car attired in regal robes, a crown
  being on the head, and the arms crossed. We are informed that "the body
  of the effigies of Oliver Cromwell lay upon a bed of state covered with a
  large pall of black velvet, and that at the feet of the effigies stood
  his crest, according to the custom of ancient monuments." The chronicler
  might, perhaps, have said with more propriety "in accordance with
  tradition;" cause and effect, original and copy, being here reversed.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In a magnificent manner (he proceeds) the effigies was carried to the
  east end of Westminster Abbey, and placed in a noble structure, which was
  raised on purpose to receive it. It remained some time exposed to public
  view, the corpse having been some days before interred in Henry VII.'s
  Chapel."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the account of the funeral obsequies of General Monk, Duke of
  Albemarle, in 1670, the writer says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Wren has acquitted himself so well, that the hearse, now that the
  effigy has been placed upon it, and surrounded by the banners and
  bannerols, is a striking and conspicuous object in the old abbey. It is
  supported by four great pillars, and rises in the centre in the shape of
  a dome."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is here also worthy of note, that Horncastle Church affords a
  curious example of the principle of a double representation&mdash;one in
  life, and the other in death; before alluded to in the Italian monuments,
  and in that of Aylmer de Valence. On a mural brass (1519), Sir Lionel
  Dymock kneels in the act of prayer; and on another plate covering the
  grave below, the body is delineated wrapt in a shroud&mdash;beyond all
  controversy dead.</p>

  <p>Mr. Markland, in his useful work, mentions "the steel-clad sires, and
  mothers mild <i>reposing</i> on their marble tombs;" and borrows from
  another archæologist an admirable description of the chapel of Edward the
  Confessor, who declares that "a more august spectacle can hardly be
  conceived, so many renowned sovereigns <i>sleeping</i> round the shrine
  of an older sovereign, the holiest of his line." It can only be the sleep
  of death, and this the sentiment conveyed: "These all died in faith." The
  subjects of this disquisition are not lounging in disrespectful
  supplication, nor wrapt in sleep enjoying pious dreams, nor stretched on
  a bed of mortal sickness: but the soul, having winged its way from sin
  and suffering, has left its tenement with the beams of hope yet lingering
  on the face, and the holy hands still refusing to relax their final
  effort. Impossible as this may seem to calculating minds, it is
  nevertheless one of the commonest of the authorised and customary modes
  designed to signify the faith, penitence, and peace attendant on a happy
  end.</p>

<h3>"ES TU SCOLARIS."</h3>

  <p>Allow me through your pages to ask some of your correspondents for
  information respecting an old and very curious book, which I picked up
  the other day. It is a thin <i>unpaged</i> octavo of twelve leaves, in
  black-letter type, without printer's name or date; but a pencil-note at
  the bottom of a quaint woodcut, representing a teacher and scholars,
  gives a date 1470! And in style of type, abbreviations, &amp;c., it seems
  evidently of about the same age with another book which I bought at the
  same time, and which bears date as printed at "Padua, 1484."</p>

  <p>The book about which I inquire bears the title <i>Es tu Scolaris</i>,
  and is a Latin-German or Dutch grammar, of a most curious and primitive
  character, proving very manifestly that when William Lilly gave to the
  world the old <i>Powle's Grammar</i>, it was not before such a work was
  needed. A few extracts from my book will give some idea of the erudition
  and etymological profundity of the "learned Theban" who compiled this
  guide to the Temple of Learning, which, if they do not instruct, will
  certainly amuse your readers. I should premise that the contractions and
  abbreviations in the printing of the book are so numerous and arbitrary,
  that it is extremely difficult to read, and that this style of printing
  condenses the subject-matter so much, that the twelve leaves would, in
  modern typography, extend to twenty or thirty. The book commences in the
  interrogatory style, in the words of its title, <i>Es tu
  Scolaris?</i>&mdash;"<i>Sum.</i>" It then proceeds to ring the changes on
  this word "<i>sum</i>," what part of speech, what kind of verb, &amp;c.;
  and setting it down as <i>verbum anormalium</i>, goes on to enumerate the
  anormalous verbs in this verse,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Sum, volo, fero, atque edo,</p>
      <p>Tot et anormala credo."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Now begins the curious lore of the volume:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Q.</i> Unde derivatur <i>sum</i>?</p>

  <p><i>A.</i> Derivatur a greca dictione, <i>hemi</i> (<span title="emi" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;&mu;&iota;</span>); mutando <i>h</i> in <i>s</i> et <i>e</i> in
  <i>u</i>, et deponendo <i>i</i>, <i>sic habes sum</i>!"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I dare say this process of derivation will be new to your classical
  readers, but as we proceed, they will say, "Foregad this is more
  exquisite fooling still."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Q.</i> Unde derivatur <i>volo</i>?</p>

  <p><i>A.</i> Derivatur a <i>beniamin</i> (sic pro <span title="boulomai" class="grk"
  >&beta;&omicron;&upsilon;&lambda;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&#x1F76;</span>)
  grece; mutando <i>ben</i> in <i>vo</i> et <i>iamin</i> in <i>lo</i>, sic
  habes <i>volo</i>. Versus</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Est <i>volo</i> formatum</p>
      <p>A <i>beniamin</i>, bene vocatum.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Q.</i> Unde derivatur <i>fero</i>?</p>

  <p><i>A.</i> Dicitur a <i>phoos</i>! grece; mutando <i>pho</i> in
  <i>fe</i> et <i>os</i> in <i>ro</i>, sic habes <i>fero</i>!</p>

  <p><i>Q.</i> Unde derivatur <i>edo</i>?</p>

  <p><i>A.</i> A <i>phagin</i>, grece; mutando <i>pha</i> in <i>e</i> et
  <i>gin</i> in <i>do</i>, sic habes <i>edo</i>!"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Here be news for etymologists, and proofs, moreover, that when some of
  the zealous antagonists of Martin Luther in the next century denounced
  "Heathen Greek" as a diabolical <i>invention</i> of his, there was little
  in the grammar knowledge of the day to contradict the accusation.</p>

  <p>But we have not yet exhausted the wonders and virtues of the word
  <i>sum</i>; the grammar lesson goes on to ask,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Q.</i> Quare <i>sum</i> non desinit in <i>o</i> nec in
  <i>or</i>?</p>

  <p><i>A.</i> Ad habendum, <i>d<span class="over">r</span><span

  <p><i>A.</i> Quia per <i>sum</i> intelligitur Trinitas, cum tres habeat
  litteras, scl. <i>s</i>. <i>u</i>. et <i>m</i>. Etiam illud verbum sum,
  quamvis de omnibus dici valeat, tamen de Deo et Trinitate proprie
  dicitur.</p>

  <p><i>Q.</i> Quare <i>sum</i> potius terminatur in <i>m</i> quam in
  <i>n</i>?</p>

  <p><i>A.</i> Quia proprie <i>m</i> rursus intelligitur Trinitas, cum illa

<h3>ON A DIGEST OF CRITICAL READINGS IN
SHAKSPEARE.</h3>

  <p>With reference to this subject, which has been so frequently discussed
  in your columns, daily experience convincing me still farther in the
  opinion that the complete performance of the task is impracticable, would
  you kindly allow me to ask what can be done in the now acknowledged case
  of frequent occurrence, where different copies of the folios and quartos
  vary in passages in the very same impression? What copies are to be taken
  as the groundworks of reference; and whose copy of the first folio is to
  be the standard one? Mr. Knight may give one reading as that of the
  edition of 1623, and Mr. Singer may offer another from the same work,
  while the author of the "critical digest" may give a third, and all of
  them correct in the mere fact that such readings are really those of the
  first edition. Thus, in respect to a passage in <i>Measure for
  Measure</i>,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"For thy own bowels, which do call thee <i>sire</i>,"&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>it has been stated in your columns that one copy of the second folio
  has this correct reading, whereas every copy I have met with reads
  <i>fire</i>; and so likewise the first and third folios. Then, again, in
  reference to this same line, Mr. Collier, in his Shakspeare, vol. ii. p.
  48., says that the folio edition of 1685 also reads <i>fire</i> for
  <i>sire</i>; but in my copy of the fourth folio it is distinctly printed
  <i>sire</i>, and the comma before the word very <!-- Page 541 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page541"></a>{541}</span>properly omitted. It
  would be curious to ascertain whether any other copies of this folio read
  <i>fire</i>.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  published under the following title, <i>Original Poems, on several
  occasions</i>, by C. R., 4to., 1769. Can you inform me whether these
  poems are likely to have been written by Miss Clara Reeve, authoress of

  <p><i>Precedence.</i>&mdash;Will any of your correspondents assign the
  order of precedence of officers in army or navy (having no decoration,
  knighthood, or companionship of any order of knighthood), not as respects
  each other, but as respects civilians? I apprehend that every commission
  is addressed to the bearer, embodying a civil title, as <i>e.g.</i>,
  "John Smith, Esquire," or as we see ensigns gazetted, "A. B., Gent." My
  impression therefore is, that in a mixed company of civilians, &amp;c.,
  no officer is entitled to take rank higher than the <i>civil</i> title
  incorporated in his commission would imply, apart from his grade in the
  service to which he belongs. On this point I should be obliged by any
  notices which your correspondents may supply; as also by a classification
  in order of precedence of the ranks which I here set down alphabetically:
  barristers, doctors (in divinity, law, medicine), esquires, queen's
  counsel, serjeants-at-law.</p>

  <p>It may be objected that esquire, ecuyer, armiger, is originally a

<h3>COLERIDGE'S UNPUBLISHED MANUSCRIPTS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 496.)</p>

  <p>In an article contained in the Number of "N. &amp; Q." for May the
  27th last, and signed <span class="sc">C. Mansfield Ingleby</span>, an
  inconsiderate, not to say a coarse attack has been made upon me, which
  might have been spared had the writer sought a private explanation of the
  matters upon which he has founded his charge.</p>

  <p>He asks, "How has Mr. Green discharged the duties of his solemn trust?
  Has he made any attempt to give publicity to the <i>Logic</i>, the 'great
  work' on <i>Philosophy</i>, the work on the Old and New Testaments, to be
  called <i>The Assertion of Religion</i>, or the <i>History of
  Philosophy</i>, all of which are in his custody, and of which the first
  is, on the testimony of Coleridge himself, a finished work?... For the
  four works enumerated above, Mr. Green is responsible."</p>

  <p>Now, though, by the terms of Coleridge's will, I do not hold myself
  "responsible" in the sense which the writer attaches to the term, and
  though I have acted throughout with the cognizance, and I believe with
  the approbation of Coleridge's family, yet I am willing, and shall now
  proceed to give such explanations as an admirer of Coleridge's writings
  may desire, or think he has a right to expect.</p>

  <p>Of the four works in question, the <i>Logic</i>&mdash;as will be seen
  by turning to the passage in the Letters, vol. ii. p. 150., to which the
  writer refers as "the testimony of Coleridge himself"&mdash;is described
  as <i>nearly</i> ready for the press, though as yet <i>unfinished</i>;
  and I apprehend it may be proved by reference to Mr. Stutfield's notes,
  the gentleman to whom it is there said they were dictated, and who
  possesses the original copy, that the work never was finished. Of the
  three parts mentioned as the components of <!-- Page 544 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page544"></a>{544}</span>the work, the
  <i>Criterion</i> and <i>Organon</i> do not to my knowledge exist; and
  with regard to the other parts of the manuscript, including the
  <i>Canon</i>, I believe that I have exercised a sound discretion in not
  publishing them in their present form and <i>unfinished</i> state.</p>

  <p>Of the alleged work on the Old and New Testaments, to be called <i>The
  Assertion of Religion</i>, I have no knowledge. There exist, doubtless,
  in Coleridge's handwriting, many notes, detached fragments and
  marginalia, which contain criticisms on the Scriptures. Many of these
  have been published, some have lost their interest by the recent advances
  in biblical criticism, and some may hereafter appear; though, as many of
  them were evidently not intended for publication, they await a final
  judgment with respect to the time, form, and occasion of their
  appearance. But no work with the title above stated, no work with any
  similar object&mdash;except the <i>Confessions of an Inquiring
  Spirit</i>&mdash;is, as far as I know, in existence.</p>

  <p>The work to which I suppose the writer alludes as the <i>History of
  Philosophy</i>, is in my possession. It was presented to me by the late
  J. Hookham Frere, and consists of notes, taken for him by an eminent
  shorthand writer, of the course of lectures delivered by Coleridge on
  that subject. Unfortunately, however, these notes are wholly unfit for
  publication, as indeed may be inferred from the fact, communicated to me
  by Coleridge, that the person employed confessed after the first lecture
  that he was unable to follow the lecturer in consequence of becoming
  perplexed and delayed by the novelty of thought and language, for which
  he was wholly unprepared by the ordinary exercise of his art. If this
  <i>History of Philosophy</i> is to be published in an intelligible form,
  it will require to be re-written; and I would willingly undertake the
  task, had I not, in connexion with Coleridge's views, other and more
  pressing objects to accomplish.</p>

  <p>I come now to the fourth work, the "great work" on <i>Philosophy</i>.
  Touching this the writer quotes from one of Coleridge's letters:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Of this work something more than a volume has been dictated by me, so
  as to exist fit for the press."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I need not here ask whether the conclusion is correct, that because
  "something more than a volume" is fit for the press, I am therefore
  responsible for the whole work, of which the "something more than a
  volume" is a part? But&mdash;shaping my answer with reference to the real
  point at issue&mdash;I have to state, for the information of Coleridge's
  readers, that, although in the materials for the volume there are
  introductions and intercalations on subjects of speculative interest,
  such as to entitle them to appear in print, the main portion of the work
  is a philosophical <i>Cosmogony</i>, which I fear is scarcely adapted for
  scientific readers, or corresponds to the requirements of modern science.
  At all events, I do not hesitate to say that the completion of the whole
  would be requisite for the intelligibility of the part which exists in
  manuscript.</p>

  <p>I leave it then to any candid person to decide whether I should have
  acted wisely in risking its committal to the press in its present shape.
  Whatever may be, however, the opinion of others, I have decided,
  according to my own conscientious conviction of the issue, against the
  experiment.</p>

  <p>But should some farther explanation be expected of me on this
  interesting topic, I will freely own that, having enjoyed the high
  privilege of communion with one of the most enlightened philosophers of
  the age&mdash;and in accordance with his wishes the responsibility rests
  with me, as far as my ability extends, of completing his
  labours,&mdash;in pursuance of this trust I have devoted more than the
  leisure of a life to a work in which I hope to present the philosophic
  views of my "great master" in a systematic form of unity&mdash;in a form
  which may best concentrate to a focus and principle of unity the light
  diffused in his writings, and which may again reflect it on all
  departments of human knowledge, so that truths may become intelligible in
  the one light of Divine truth.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile I can assure the friends and admirers of Coleridge that
  nothing now exists in manuscript which would add materially to the
  elucidation of his philosophical doctrines; and that in any farther
  publication of his literary remains I shall be guided, as I have been, by
  the duty which I owe to the memory and fame of my revered teacher.</p>

<h3>KING JAMES'S IRISH ARMY LIST, 1689.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., pp. 30, 31. 401.)</p>

  <p>I was much pleased at <span class="sc">Mr. D'Alton's</span>
  announcement of his work; and I should have responded to it sooner, if I
  could have had any idea that he did not possess King's <i>State of the
  Protestants in Ireland</i>; but his inquiry about Colonel Sheldon, in
  Vol. ix., p. 401., shows that he has not consulted that work, where (p.
  341.) he will find that Dominick Sheldon was "Lieutenant-General of the
  Horse." But after the enumeration of the General Staff, there follows a
  list of the field officers of eight regiments of horse, seven of
  dragoons, and fifty of infantry. In Tyrconnel's regiment of horse,
  Dominick Sheldon appears as lieutenant-colonel. This must have been, I
  suppose, a Sheldon junior, son or nephew of the lieutenant-general of
  horse. This reference to King's work has suggested to me an idea which I
  venture to suggest to <span class="sc">Mr. D'Alton</span> as a
  preliminary to the larger work on Irish family genealogies which he is
  about, and for which we shall <!-- Page 545 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page545"></a>{545}</span>have I fear to wait too long. I mean an
  immediate reprint (in a separate shape) of the several lists of gentlemen
  of both parties which are given in King's work. This might be done with
  very little trouble, and, I think, without any pecuniary loss, if not
  with actual profit. It would be little more than pamphlet size. The first
  and most important list would be of the names and designations of all the
  persons included in the acts of attainder passed in King James's Irish
  Parliament of May, 1689. They are, I think, about two thousand names,
  with their residences and personal designations; and it is interesting to
  find that a great many of the same families are still seated in the same
  places. These names I think I should place alphabetically in one list,
  with their designations and residences; and any short notes that <span
  class="sc">Mr. D'Alton</span> might think necessary to correct clerical
  error, or explain doubtful names: longer notes would perhaps lead too far
  into family history for the limited object I propose.</p>

  <p>In a second list, I would give the names of King James's parliament,
  privy council, army, civil and judicial departments, as we find them in
  King, adding to them an alphabetical index of names. The whole would then
  exhibit a synopsis of the names, residences, and politics of a
  considerable portion of the gentry of Ireland at that important
  period.</p>

<h3>BARRELL'S REGIMENT.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., pp. 63. 159.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent H. B. C. is undoubtedly correct in his statement
  that "Ten times a day whip the Barrels," is a regimental parody on the
  song "He that has the best Wife," sung in Charles Coffey's musical farce
  of <i>The Devil to Pay</i>, published in 1731. Popular songs have been
  made the subject of political or personal parodies from time immemorial;
  and no more fruitful locality for parodies can be found than a barrack,
  where the individual traits of character are so fully developed, and
  afford so full a scope to the talents of a satirist. Indeed, I knew an
  officer, who has recently retired from the service, who seized on every
  popular ballad, and parodied it, in connexion with regimental affairs, to
  the delight of his brother officers; and in many instances his parodies
  were far more witty than the original comic songs whence they were
  taken.</p>

  <p>As regards the regiment known as Barrell's, at the period assigned as
  the date of the song relative to that corps, <i>i. e.</i> circa 1747,
  there can be no doubt as to what corps is alluded to. Barrell's regiment,
  now the 4th, or King's Own, regiment of infantry, is the only corps that
  was ever known in the British army as Barrell's; for although Colonel
  William Barrell was colonel of the present 28th regiment from Sept. 27,
  1715, to August 25, 1730, and of the present 22nd regiment from the
  latter date to August 8, 1734, yet neither of these regiments appears to
  have seen any war-service during the periods that they were commanded by
  him, or to have been known in military history as Barrell's regiments. He
  was appointed to the 4th regiment of infantry August 8, 1734, and
  retained the command of that distinguished corps exactly fifteen years,
  for he died August 9, 1749. While he commanded the regiment it embarked
  for Flanders, and served the campaign of 1744, under Field-Marshal Wade.
  It remained in Flanders until the rebellion broke out in Scotland, when
  it returned to England, and marched from Newcastle-on-Tyne to Scotland in
  January, 1746, arriving on the 10th of that month at Edinburgh. The
  regiment was engaged at the battle of Falkirk, Jan. 17, 1746, where its
  conduct is thus noticed in the <i>General Advertiser</i>: "The regiments
  which distinguished themselves were Barrell's (King's Own), and
  Ligonier's foot." Ligonier's regiment is now the glorious 48th regiment,
  of Albuera fame.</p>

  <p>At the battle of Culloden Barrell's regiment gained the greatest
  reputation imaginable; the battle was so desperate that the soldiers'
  bayonets were stained with blood to the muzzles of their muskets; there
  was scarce an officer or soldier of the regiment, and of that part of
  Munro's (now 37th regiment) which engaged the rebels, that did not kill
  one or two men each with their bayonets. (<i>Particulars of the
  Battle</i>, published 1746.) Now it will be remembered that your
  correspondent E. H., Vol. ix., p. 159., represents a drummer of the
  regiment interceding with the colonel for the prisoner, by stating that
  "he behaved well at Culloden." And this leads me to the question, Who was
  the colonel against whom this caricature was directed? It is proved ("N.
  &amp; Q.," Vol. vii., p. 242.) that regiments were known by the names of
  their <i>colonels</i>, whether commanded personally by the colonel or
  not, until July 1, 1751, and indeed for several subsequent years.</p>

  <p>Now the reference to Culloden renders it probable that the colonel
  appealed to was present at that battle, and perhaps an eye-witness of the
  personal bravery on that occasion of the soldier who was subsequently
  flogged. But although Colonel Barrell <i>retained</i> the colonelcy of
  the 4th Infantry until August, 1749, yet he was promoted to major-general
  in 1735, after which time he would have commanded a <i>division</i>, not
  a <i>regiment</i>. In 1739 he was farther promoted to lieut.-general, and
  appointed the same year Governor of Pendennis Castle, which office would
  necessarily remove him from the personal command of his regiment. He was
  not present at the battle of Culloden, April 16, 1746, where his regiment
  was commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Robert <!-- Page 546 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page546"></a>{546}</span>Rich, who was wounded
  on that occasion. As to the epithet of "Colonel," used by the drummer,
  that term is always used in conversation when addressing a
  lieutenant-colonel, or even a brevet lieutenant-colonel, and its use only
  proves, therefore, that the officer in command of the parade held a
  higher rank than major. After Culloden, the 4th regiment moved to the
  Highlands, and in 1747 returned to Stirling. In 1749 General Barrell
  died, and the colonelcy of the regiment was given to Lieut.-Colonel Rich,
  whom I suspect to be the officer alluded to in the caricature. I have
  searched the military records of the 4th regiment, but can find no
  mention of the places at which it was stationed from 1747 to 1754, in the
  spring of which year it embarked from Great Britain for the
  Mediterranean, just as it is now doing in the spring of 1854. I am
  inclined to fix the date of the print as 1749 (not 1747), when "Old
  Scourge" <i>returned</i> to his regiment as colonel, at the decease of
  General Barrell. Colonel Rich was not promoted to major-general until
  Jan. 17, 1758, and his commission as colonel is dated Aug. 22, 1749, the
  day on which he became colonel of the 4th regiment. He died in 1785, but
  retired from the service between the years 1771 and 1776: he succeeded
  his father as a baronet in 1768.</p>

<h3>CLAY TOBACCO-PIPES.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 372.)</p>

  <p>I was much pleased at reading <span class="sc">Mr. H. T.
  Riley's</span> Note on this neglected subject, in which I take no small
  interest, and feel happy in communicating the little amount of
  information I possess regarding it. I have long thought that the habit of
  smoking, I do not say tobacco, but some other herb, is of much greater
  antiquity than is generally supposed. Tobacco appears to have been
  introduced amongst us about 1586 by Captain R. Greenfield and Sir Francis
  Drake (vide Brand's <i>Popular Antiquities</i>); but I have seen
  pipe-bowls of English manufacture, which had been found <i>beneath</i>
  the encaustic pavement of Buildwas Abbey in Shropshire, which gives a
  much earlier date to the practice of smoking <i>something</i>. I remember
  an old man, a perfect Dominie Sampson in his way, who had been in turn
  gaoler, pedagogue, and postmaster, at St. Briavel's, near Tintern Abbey,
  habitually smoking the leaves of coltsfoot, which he cultivated on
  purpose; he told me that he could seldom afford to use tobacco. The pipes
  found in such abundance in the bed of the Thames, and everywhere in and
  about London, I believe to be of Dutch manufacture; they are identical
  with those which Teniers and Ostade put into the mouths of their boors,
  and have for the most part a small pointed heel, a well-defined milled
  ring around the lip, and bear no mark or name of the maker. Such were the
  pipes used by the soldiers of the Parliament, to be found wherever they
  encamped. I will only instance Barton, near Abingdon, on the property of
  G. Bowyer, Esq., M.P., where I have seen scores while shooting in the
  fields around the ruins of the old fortified mansion. The English pipes,
  on the contrary, have a very broad and flat heel, on which they may rest
  in an upright position, so that the ashes might not fall out prematurely;
  and on this heel the potter's name or device is usually stamped,
  generally in raised characters, though sometimes they are incised.
  Occasionally the mark is to be found on the side of the bowl. A short
  time ago I exhibited a series of some five-and-twenty different types at
  the Archæological Institution, and my collection has been enlarged
  considerably since. These were principally found in Shropshire and
  Staffordshire, and appear for the most part to have been made at
  Broseley. They are of a very hard and compact clay, which retains the
  impress of the milled ring and the stamp in all its original freshness. I
  shall feel much obliged by receiving any additional information upon this
  subject.</p>

<h3>MADAME DE STAËL.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 451.)</p>

  <p>I cannot direct R. A. to the passage in Madame de Staël's works. The
  German book for which he inquires is not by Schlegel <i>assisted</i> by
  Fichte, but&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Friedrich Nicolai's Leben und sonderbare Meinungen. Ein Beitrag zur
  Literatur-Geschichte des vergangenen und zur Pädagogik des angehenden
  Jahrhunderts, von Johan Gottlieb Fichte. Herausgegeben von A. W.
  Schlegel: Tubingen, 1801, 8<sup>o</sup>, pp. 130."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There certainly is no ground for the charge that Fichte attacked
  Nicolai when he was too old to reply. Nicolai was born in 1733, and died
  in 1811; so that he was sixty-eight when this pamphlet was published. His
  <i>Leben Sempronius Gundiberts</i> was published in 1798; and your
  correspondent H. C. R. (Vol. vii., p. 20.) partook of his hospitality in
  Berlin in 1803.</p>

  <p>As to the provocation, Fichte (at p. 82.) gives an account of attacks
  on his personal honour; the worst of which seems to be the imputation of
  seeking favourable notices in the <i>Literary Gazette</i> of Jena. In
  <i>Gundibert</i> Fichte's writings were severely handled, but no personal
  imputation was made. I do not know what was said of him in the <i>Neue
  Deutsche Bibliothek</i>, but I can hardly imagine any justification for
  so furious an attack <!-- Page 547 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page547"></a>{547}</span>as this on Nicolai. I also concur with
  Madame de Staël in thinking the book dull: "Non est jocus esse malignum."
  It begins with an attempt at grave burlesque, but speedily degenerates
  into mere scolding. Take one example:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Es war sehr wahr, dass aus seinen (Nicolais) Händen alles beschmutzt
  und verdreht herausging; aber es war nicht wahr, das er beschmutzen und
  verdrehen wollte. Es ward ihm nur so durch die Eigenschaft seiner Natur.
  Wer möchte ein Stinkthier beschuldigen, dass es bohafter Weise alles was
  es zu sich nehme, in Gestank,&mdash;oder die Natter, das sie es in Gift
  verwandle. Diese Thiere sind daran sehr unschuldig; sie folgen nur ihrer
  Natur. Eben so unser Held, der nun einmal zum literarischen Stinkthier
  und der Natter des achtzehnten Jahrhunderts bestimmt war, verbreitete
  stank um sich, und spritze Gift, nicht aus Bosheit, sondern lediglich
  durch seine Bestimmung getrieben."&mdash;P. 78.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The charge of defiling all he touched will be appreciated by those who
  have read <i>Sebaldus Nothanker</i> and <i>Sempronius Gundibert</i>, two
  of the purest as well as of the cleverest novels of the last century.</p>

<h3>CRANMER'S MARTYRDOM.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 392.)</p>

  <p>The long-received account of a very striking act in the martyrdom of
  Cranmer is declared to involve an "impossibility." The question is an
  important one in various ways, for it involves moral and religious, as
  well as literary and physiological, considerations of deep interest; but
  as I think the pages of "N. &amp; Q." not the most appropriate vehicle
  for discussion on the former heads, I shall pass them over at present
  with a mere expression of regret that such a subject should have been so
  mooted there. With reference, then, to the literary evidence in favour of
  the fact, that the noble martyr voluntarily put forth his hand into the
  hottest part of the fire which was raging about him, and burnt it first,
  the historians quoted are entirely agreed, differing as they do only in
  such details as might seem rather to imply independent testimony than
  discrepant authority. But the action is declared to be "utterly
  impossible, because," &amp;c. Why beg the question in this way?
  "Because," says H. B. C., "the laws of physiology and combustion show
  that he could not have gone beyond <i>the attempt</i>;" adding, "If the
  hand were chained over the fire, the shock would produce death." Leaving
  the <i>hypothetical</i> reasoning in both cases to go for what it is
  worth, it would surely be easy to produce facts of almost every week from
  the evidence given in coroners' inquests, in which persons have had their
  limbs burnt off&mdash;to say nothing of farther injury&mdash;without the
  shock "producing death." The only question then which I think can fairly
  arise, is, whether a person in Cranmer's position could
  <i>voluntarily</i> endure that amount of mutilation by fire which many
  others have <i>accidentally</i> suffered? This may be matter of opinion,
  but I have no doubt, and I suppose no truly Christian philosopher will
  have any, that the man who has faith to "give his body to be burned," and
  to endure heroically such a form of martyrdom, would be quite able to do
  what is attributed to Cranmer, and to Hooper too, "high medical
  authority" to the contrary notwithstanding. I might, indeed, adduce what
  might be called "high medical authority" for my view, <i>i. e.</i> the
  historical evidence of the fact, but I think the bandying of opinions on
  such a subject undesirable. It would be more to the point, especially if
  there really existed any ground for "historic doubt" on the subject, or
  if there was any good reason for creating one, to cite cotemporaneous
  evidence against that usually received. With respect to the heart of the
  martyr being "entire and unconsumed among the ashes," I must be permitted
  to say that, neither on physiological nor other grounds, does even this
  alleged fact, taken in its plain and obvious meaning, strike me as
  forming one of the "impossibilities of history."</p>

  <p class="author">J. H.</p>

  <p class="address">Rotherfield.</p>

  <p>Your correspondent H. B. C. doubts the possibility of the story about
  Cranmer's hand, and says that "if a furnace were so constructed that a
  man might hold his hand in the flame without burning his body, the shock
  to the nervous system would deprive him of all command over muscular
  action before the skin could be entirely consumed. If the hand were
  chained over the fire, the shock would produce death." Now, this last
  assertion I doubt. The following is an extract from the account of
  Ravaillac's execution, given with wonderfully minute details by an
  eye-witness, and published in Cimber's <i>Archives Curieux de l'Histoire
  de France</i>, vol. xv. p. 103.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On le couche sur l'eschaffaut, on attache les chevaux aux mains et
  aux pieds. Sa main droite percée d'un cousteau fut bruslée à feu de
  souphre. Ce misérable, pour veoir comme ceste exécrable main rotissoit,
  eut le courage de hausser la teste et de la secouer pour abattre une
  étincelle de feu qui se prenoit à sa barbe."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>So far was this from killing him that he was torn with red-hot
  pincers, had melted lead, &amp;c. poured into his wounds, and he was then
  "longuement tiré, retiré, et promené de tous costez" by four horses:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"S'il y eut quelque pause, ce ne fut que pour donner temps au bourreau
  de respirer, au patient de se sentir mourir, aux théologiens de
  l'exhorter à dire la vérité."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And still:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sa vie estoit forte et vigoureuse; telle que retirant <!-- Page 548
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page548"></a>{548}</span>une fois une
  des jambes, il arresta le cheval qui le tiroit."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I fear your correspondent underrates the power of the human body in
  enduring torture. I have seen a similar account of the execution of
  Damiens, with which I will not shock your readers. The subject is a
  revolting one, but the truth ought to be known, as it is (most humanely,
  I fully believe) questioned.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Difficulties in making soluble Cotton.</i>&mdash;In making soluble
  cotton according to the formula given by Mr. Hadow in the <i>Photographic
  Journal</i>, and again by <span class="sc">Mr. Shadbolt</span> in "N.
  &amp; Q.," I have been subject to the most provoking failures, and should
  feel obliged if <span class="sc">Mr. Shadbolt</span> or any other of your
  correspondents could explain the causes of my failures, which I will
  endeavour to describe.</p>

  <p>1st. In using nitrate of potash and sulphuric acid, with a certain
  quantity of water as given, I have <i>invariably</i> found that on adding
  the cotton to the mixture it became <i>completely dissolved</i>, and the
  mass began to effervesce violently, throwing off dense volumes of deep
  red fumes, and the whole appearing of a similar colour. I at first
  thought it might be the fault of the sulphuric acid; but on trying some
  fresh, procured at another place, the same effects were produced.</p>

  <p>Again, in using the mixed acids (which I tried, not being successful
  with the other method) I found, on following Mr. Hadow's plan, that the
  cotton was also entirely dissolved.</p>

  <p>How is the proper temperature at which the cotton is to be immersed to
  be arrived at? Are there any thermometers constructed for the purpose?
  as, if one of the ordinary ones, mounted on wood or metal, was used, the
  acids would attack it, and, I should imagine, prove injurious to the
  liquids.</p>

  <p>At the same time I would ask the reason why all the negative calotypes
  I have taken lately, both on Turner's and Sandford's papers, iodized
  according to <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond's</span> plan, are never
  intense, especially the skies, by transmitted light, although by
  reflected light they look of a beautiful black and white. I never used
  formerly to meet with such a failure; but at that time I used always to
  wet the plate glass and attach the paper to it, making it adhere by
  pressing with blotting-paper, and then exciting with a buckles brush and
  dilute gallo-nitrate. But the inconvenience attending that plan was, that
  I was compelled to take out as many double slides as I wished to take
  pictures, which made me abandon it and take to <span class="sc">Dr.
  Diamond's</span> plan of exciting them and placing them in a portfolio
  for use. I imagine the cause of their not being so intense is the not
  exposing them while wet.</p>

  <p>A bag made of yellow calico, single thickness, has been recommended
  for changing the papers in the open air. I am satisfied it will not do,
  especially if the sun is shining; it may do in some shady places, but I
  have never yet seen any yellow calico so fine in texture as not to allow
  of the rays of light passing through it, unless two or three times
  doubled. I have proved to my own satisfaction that the papers will not
  bear exposure in a bag of single thickness, without browning over
  immediately the developing fluid is applied.</p>

  <p>With regard to the using of thin collodion, as recommended by Mr.
  Hardwick in the last Number of the <i>Photographic Journal</i>, I am
  satisfied it is the only plan of producing thoroughly good positives; and
  I have been in the habit of thinning down collodion in the same manner
  for a long time, finding that I produced much better pictures with about
  half the time of exposure necessary for a thick collodion.</p>

  <p class="author">H. U.</p>

  <p><i>Light in Cameras.</i>&mdash;I cannot sufficiently express my
  acknowledgments to "N. &amp; Q." for the photographic benefits I have
  derived from its perusal, more especially from the communication in No.
  240. of <span class="sc">Lux in Camera</span>. Since I took up the art
  some months ago, I have had (with two or three exceptions) nothing but a
  succession of failures, principally from the browning of the negatives,
  and on examining my camera, as recommended by <span class="sc">Lux in
  Camera</span>, I find it lets in a blaze of light from the cause he
  mentions<a name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, and
  thence doubtless my disappointments. But why inflict this history upon
  you? I inclose for your acceptance the best photograph I have yet
  produced from <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond's</span> "Simplicity of the
  Calotype." Printed from Delamotte's directions:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Is there any better plan than the above?</p>

  <p><i>Cameras.</i>&mdash;The note of <span class="sc">Lux in
  Camera</span> has brought in more than one letter of thanks; and a valued
  correspondent has written to us, suggesting "That the attention of the
  Photographic Society, who have as yet done far less than they might have
  done to advance the Art, should be <i>at once</i> turned, and that
  seriously and earnestly, to the production of a light, portable, and
  effective camera for field purposes; one which, at the same time that it
  has the advantages of lightness and portability, should be capable of
  resisting our variable climate." Our correspondent throws out a hint
  which possibly may be adopted with advantage, <!-- Page 549 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page549"></a>{549}</span>that papier maché has
  many of the requisites desired, being very firm, light, and impervious to
  wet.</p>

  <p><i>Progress of Photography.</i>&mdash;As a farther contribution to the
  History of Photography, we have been favoured with the following copy of
  a letter from a well-known amateur, which details in a graphic manner his
  early photographic experiences.</p>

  <p>"As there is a sort of reflux of the tide to Mr. Fox Talbot's plan,
  and different people have succeeded best in different ways, it may amuse
  you to hear how I <i>used</i> to work, with better luck than I have had
  since.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Talbot's sensitive wash was very strong, so he floated his paper
  upon distilled water immediately after its application.</p>

  <p>"Mr. G. S. Cundell, of Finsbury Circus, diluted the sensitive wash
  with water, instead of floating the paper. Amateurs date their success
  from the time Mr. Cundell published this simple modification of the
  original process.</p>

  <p>"Mr. William Hunt, of Yarmouth, was my first friend and instructor in
  the art; and <i>if</i> there be any merit in the pictures I did before I
  knew you, the credit is due to <i>him entirely</i>.</p>

  <p>"The first paper we tried was Whatman's ivory post, very thick and
  hard, and yet it gave good negatives. We afterwards got a thinner paper,
  but always stuck to Whatman. Neither were we troubled with that
  <i>porosity</i> in the skies of which you complain in the more
  recently-made papers of that manufacturer.</p>

  <p>"We first washed the paper with a solution of nitrate of silver,
  fifteen grains to the ounce, going over the surface in all directions
  with a camel-hair brush. As soon as the fluid ceased to run, the paper
  was <i>rapidly dried before the fire</i>, and then immersed in a solution
  of iodide of potassium, 500 grains to the pint of water. We used to draw
  it through the solution frequently by the corners, and then let it lie
  till the yellow tint was visible at the back. It was then immediately
  taken to the pump and pumped upon vigorously for two or three minutes,
  holding it at such an angle that the water flushed softly over the
  surface. We then gave it a few minutes in a rain-water bath, inclining
  the dish at different angles to give motion to the water. By this time
  the iodide of silver looked like pure solid brimstone in the wet paper.
  Then we knew that it was good, and hung it up to dry.</p>

  <p>"To make this paper sensitive, we took 5 drops of gallic acid
  (saturated solution), 5 drops of glacial acetic acid, 10 drops of a
  50-grain solution of nitrate of silver, and 100 drops of water. The
  sensitive wash was poured upon a glass plate, and the paper placed
  thereon. We used to lift the paper frequently by one or other corner till
  it was perfectly limp. We then blotted off and placed in the camera,
  where it would keep a good many hours.</p>

  <p>"Whether such pictures would have come out spontaneously under the
  developing solution, I know not, for we had not patience enough to try.
  We forced them out in double quick time with red-hot pokers; and great
  was the alarm of my wife to see me rush madly about the house armed with
  these weapons. Yet the plan had its advantages; by presenting the point
  of the poker at a refractory spot, its reluctance to appear was speedily
  overcome, and we persuaded out the shadows.</p>

  <p class="author">* * *</p>

  <p>"P.S.&mdash;I now have the first picture I ever did, little, if at
  all, altered. It was done in July, 1845, with a common meniscus lens. I
  have just got a <i>capital negative</i> by <span class="sc">Dr.
  Diamond's</span> plan, but which is spoiled by the metallic abominations
  in Turner's paper."</p>

  <p><i>A Collodion Difficulty.</i>&mdash;With reference to <span
  class="sc">Mr. J. Cook's</span> collodion, I would suggest that his ether
  was indeed "still very strong" of <i>acid</i>; by which the iodine was
  set free, and gave him "nearly a port-wine colour." This is a common
  occurrence when the ether or the collodion is acid. The remedy is at
  hand, however. Powder a few grains of <i>cyanide of potassium</i>, and
  introduce about a grain at a time, according to the quantity: shake up
  till dissolved, and so on, until you get the clear golden tint. Thus will
  "the mystery be cleared up." I need not say that the essential properties
  of the solution will not be impaired.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Andrew Steinmetz.</span></p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;In a day or two I shall send you a <i>recipe</i> for easily
  turning to immediate use the "used-up dipping baths" of <i>nitrate</i>,
  without the troublesome process recommended to one of your
  correspondents.</p>

  <p><i>Ferricyanide of Potassium.</i>&mdash;I have used with success the
  ferricyanide of potassium (the <i>red</i> prussiate of potash, as it is
  called) for removing the stains contracted in photographing. This it does
  very readily when the stains are recent, and it has no injurious effect
  upon cuts and sore places should any exist on the hands. An old stain may
  with a little pumice be very readily removed. I have mentioned this to
  several friends, and, if not a novelty, it is certainly not generally
  known.</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Postage System of the Romans</i> (Vol. ix., p. 350.).&mdash;Your
  correspondent <span class="sc">Ardelio</span> probably alludes to the
  system of posts for the conveyance of persons, established by the Romans
  on their great lines of road. An account of this may be seen in the work
  of Bergier, <i>Histoire des Grands Chemins de l'Empire Romain</i>, lib.
  iv.; and compare Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall</i>, chap. xvii.
  Communications were made from Rome to the governors of provinces, and
  information was received from them, by means of these posts: see Suet.
  <i>Oct.</i> c. xlix. But the Romans had no public institution for the
  conveyance of private letters. A letter post is a comparatively modern
  institution; in England it only dates from the reign of James I. An
  account of the ancient Persian posts is given by Xenoph. <i>Cyrop.</i>

  <p><i>Burial Service Tradition</i> (Vol. ix., p. 451.).&mdash;The only
  cases in which a clergyman is legally justified in refusing to read the
  entire service over the body of a parishioner or other person admitted to
  burial in the parochial cemetery, are the three which are mentioned in
  the preliminary rubric, which, as expounded by the highest authorities,
  are as follows: 1. In case the person died without admission to the
  universal church by Christian baptism. 2. Or "denounced 'excommunicate
  majori excommunicatione' for some grievous and notorious crime, and no
  man able to testify of his repentance." (Canon 68.) 3. Or <i>felo de
  se</i>; for in a case of suicide the acquittal of the deceased by a
  coroner's jury entitles him to Christian burial. The extraordinary notion
  of the clergyman, mentioned by the <span class="sc">Rev. S. Adams</span>,
  is certainly erroneous in law. I can only suppose it originated from some
  case in which the severance of the deceased's right hand was regarded by
  the jury as a proof that he did not kill himself. Except in certain
  special cases, none but parishioners are entitled to burial in a
  parochial burying-place at all.</p>

  <p><i>Paintings of our Saviour</i> (Vol. ix., p. 270.).&mdash;Your
  correspondent J. P. may hear of something to his advantage by visiting
  the church of Santa Prassede (Saint Praxedes?), not far from Santa Maria
  Maggiore in Rome. In the former he will see, as usual, a list of
  wonderful relics preserved therein, and amongst them "A Portrait of the
  Saviour, presented by St. Peter to Santa Prassede." A valuable gift,
  truly, if only authentic. The name of the artist is not given, I believe,
  in the above veracious document. They had better have made the catalogue
  complete by putting in the name of St. Luke himself, whose pencil, I
  rather think, is stated to have furnished other such portraits elsewhere.
  "Credat Judæus!"</p>

  <p>The Santa Prassede above alluded to is stated to have been a daughter
  of Pudens, mentioned in the Epistles of St. Paul.</p>

  <p><i>Widdrington Family</i> (Vol. ix., p. 375.).&mdash;The church of
  Nunnington, near Helmsly, in the North <!-- Page 551 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page551"></a>{551}</span>Riding of Yorkshire,
  contains two handsome marble monuments of Lords Preston and Widdrington.
  The old hall at Nunnington, now occupied by a farmer, was once the seat
  of Viscount Preston, and afterwards of Lord Widdrington. William, Lord
  Widdrington, who is said to be descended from the brave Witherington,
  celebrated in Chevy Chace for having fought upon his stumps, was of the
  very noble and ancient family of the Widdringtons of Widdrington Castle,
  in the county of Northumberland; and great-grandson of the brave Lord
  Widdrington who was slain gallantly fighting in the service of the crown
  at Wigan, in Lancashire, in 1651. William, his grandson, was
  unfortunately engaged in the affair of Preston in 1715, when his estate
  became forfeited to the crown, and he afterwards confined himself to
  private life. He married a daughter of the Lord Viscount Preston above
  mentioned, one of the co-heiresses of the estate at Nunnington, and was
  in consequence buried in the family vault in 1743, aged sixty-five. For
  other particulars of the family of Widdrington, see Camden's
  <i>Britannia</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Table-turning</i> (Vol. ix., pp. 88. 135., &amp;c.).&mdash;In
  turning over Sozomen's <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>, I observed at b.
  <span class="sm">VI.</span> ch. 34. an account of the transaction already
  printed in your pages from Ammianus Marcellinus. It is in brief as
  follows:&mdash;Certain philosophers who were opposed to Christianity were
  anxious to learn who should succeed Valens in the empire. After trying
  all other kinds of divination, they constructed a tripod (or table with
  three legs: see Servius on Virgil, <i>Æn.</i> <span
  class="sm">III.</span> 360.) of laurel wood, and by means of certain
  incantations and formulæ, succeeded (by combining the letters which were
  indicated, one by one, by a contrivance of some kind connected with the
  table) in obtaining Th. E. O. D. Now, being anxious and hopeful for one
  Theodorus to succeed to the throne, they concluded that he was meant.
  Valens, hearing of it, put him and them to death, and many others whose
  names began with these letters.</p>

  <p>On referring to Socrates, I find that he also names the circumstances
  just alluded to. Although he does not give all the particulars, he adds
  one important statement, which serves to identify the thing more closely
  with modern table-moving and spirit-rapping. "The devil," he says,
  "induced certain curious persons to practise <i>divination, by calling up
  the spirits of the dead</i> (<span title="nekuomanteian poiêsasthai" class="grk"
  >&nu;&epsilon;&kappa;&upsilon;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&epsilon;&#x1F77;&alpha;&nu;
  &pi;&omicron;&iota;&#x1F75;&sigma;&alpha;&sigma;&theta;&alpha;&iota;</span>),
  in order to find out who should reign after Valens." They succeeded in
  obtaining the letters Th. E. O. D.</p>

  <p>I observe a reference to Nicephorus, b. <span class="sm">XI.</span>
  45., but have not his works at hand to consult. <!-- Page 552 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page552"></a>{552}</span></p>

  <p>The use of <i>laurel</i>, in the construction of the table, seems to
  connect the occurrences with the worship of Apollo. Those who would
  investigate the subject fully must consult such passages in the classics
  as this from Lucan [Lucretius?], lib. i. 739-40.:</p>

  <p>as "carved in a beam over the Town Hall of Much Wenlock, in
  Shropshire." They are to be found also in the ancient hall of judicature
  of the "Palazzo del Podesta," at Pistoja, in Tuscany. The ancient stone
  seats, with their stone table in front of them, where the magistrates of
  the republic administered justice in the days of the city's independence,
  are still remaining, and these lines are cut in the stone just over the
  benches. This simple and primitive tribunal was built as it now stands in
  1307, and there can be no doubt that the verses in question existed there
  before they found their way to Much Wenlock. But as it is hardly likely
  that they travelled direct from Tuscany into Shropshire, the probability
  is that they may be found in some other, or perhaps in many other places.
  I have not been able to light on any clue to the authorship or history of
  the lines. Perhaps some of your correspondents, who have the means of
  wider researches than this city commands, might be more fortunate.</p>

  than reformed. The last published map is considered the most exact and
  useful; it, therefore, is the interest of the map-seller to sell off all
  of the old ones that he can; hence it is difficult, unless some pains are
  taken, to ascertain which is the last. A. publishes a new map of France,
  B. then publishes one; but <i>both</i> avoid putting the date, as the
  oldest date would sell fewer, and the newer map proprietor expects a
  still newer one soon to appear. By A. I do not mean to allude to Mr.
  Arrowsmith in particular, who is one of the best, if not the best,
  map-seller we have. But why are large military map-sellers so much dearer
  with us than on the Continent? I must except the Ordnance map, which is
  now sold cheaply, thanks entirely to Mr. Hume's exertions in

  <p><i>Corporation Enactments</i> (Vol. ix., p. 300.).&mdash;Your
  correspondent <span class="sc">Abhba</span> having omitted to mention
  where he found the curious piece of information which under this title he
  supplied to you, I beg leave to supply the deficiency. The same
  paragraph, nearly <i>verbatim</i>, has been long since published in a
  book which is by no means rare, the <i>Dublin Penny Journal</i>, vol. i.
  p. 226. (No. 29, January 12, 1833), where it appears thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the town books of the corporation of Youghal, among many other
  singular enactments of that body, are two which will now be regarded as
  curiosities. In the years 1680 and 1700, a cook and a barber were made
  freemen, on condition that they should severally <!-- Page 554 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page554"></a>{554}</span>dress the mayor's
  feasts, and shave the corporation&mdash;gratis!"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Is not this the very paragraph which has been supplied to you as an
  original? The attempt to disguise it by the alteration of two or three
  words is below criticism. Surely, if passages from common or easily
  accessible books are to occupy valuable space in the pages of "N. &amp;
  Q.," it is not too much to expect that reference be honestly given to the
  work which may be cited.</p>

  <p class="address">Dublin.</p>

  <p><i>Misapplication of Terms</i> (Vol. ix., p. 361.).&mdash;Your
  correspondent is quite entitled to the references he demands, and which I
  had considered superfluous. I beg to refer him to the school dictionaries
  in use by my boys, viz. Mr. Young's and Dr. Carey's edition of
  <i>Ainsworth</i>, abridged by Dr. Morell; also to the following, all I
  possess, viz. Dr. Adam Littleton's, 4to. 4th ed., 1703; Robertson's ed.
  of <i>Gouldman</i>, 4to., 1674; and Gesner's <i>Thesaurus</i>, 4 vols.
  fol. I may add that the observations of Horne Tooke are quite to my mind,
  especially when applied to the "legendary stories of nurses and old
  women." (Todd's <i>Johnson</i>.)</p>

  <p>Working in the same direction as your correspondent who has caused
  this invasion of your space, I cannot resist the opportunity of
  protesting against the use of "opened up" and "opened out," as applied to
  the developments of national enterprise and industry. These expressions,
  common to many, and frequently to be read in the "leading journal," stand
  a fair chance of becoming established vulgarisms. It is, however,
  something worse than slipshod when a paper of equal pretension, and more
  particularly addressed to the families of the educated classes, informs
  its readers "that some of the admirers of the late Justice Talfourd
  contemplate the erection of a <i>cenotaph over his grave</i> in the
  cemetery at Norwood." (<i>Illustrated News</i>, March 25, 1854.)</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>On the publication of the first volume of Mr. Peter Cunningham's
  edition of <i>The Works of Oliver Goldsmith</i>, we did not hesitate to
  pronounce it "the best, handsomest, and cheapest edition of Goldsmith
  which has ever issued from the press." The work is now completed by the
  publication of the fourth volume, which contains Goldsmith's Biographies;
  Reviews; Animated Nature; Cock Lane Ghost; Vida's Game of Chess (now
  first printed as it has been found transcribed in Goldsmith's handwriting
  from the original MS. in the possession of Mr. Bolton Corney), and his
  Letters. And after a careful revision of the book, we do not hesitate to
  repeat our original opinion. It is a book which every lover of Goldsmith
  will delight to place upon his shelves.</p>

  <p>We have to congratulate Mr. Darling, and also all who are interested
  in any way in theological literature, on the completion of that portion
  of his <i>Cyclopædia Bibliographica</i> which gives us, under the names
  of the authors, an account, not only of the best works extant in various
  branches of literature, but more particularly on those important
  divisions, biblical criticism, commentaries, sermons, dissertations, and
  other illustrations of the Holy Scriptures; the constitution, government,
  and liturgies of the Christian Church; ecclesiastical history and
  biography; the works of the Fathers, and all the most eminent Divines. We
  sincerely trust that a work so obviously useful, and which has been so
  carefully compiled, will meet with such encouragement as will justify Mr.
  Darling in very speedily going to press with the second and not less
  important division&mdash;that in which, by an alphabetical arrangement of
  subjects, a ready reference may be made to books, treatises, sermons, and
  dissertations on nearly all heads of divinity, theological controversy,
  or ecclesiastical inquiry. The utility of such an Index is too obvious to
  require one word of argument in its favour.</p>

  <p>The subject of the non-purchase of the Faussett Collection by the
  Trustees of the British Museum was brought before Parliament by Mr. Ewart
  on Thursday, 1st June, when copies were ordered to be laid before the
  House of Commons "of all reports, memorials, or other communications to
  or from the Trustees of the British Museum on the subject of the Faussett
  Collection of Anglo-Saxon Antiquities."</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;Miss Strickland's

  occupied with the biography of Mary Beatrice of Modena, the Queen of

  of inedited materials.&mdash;<i>Selections from the Writings of the Rev.
  Sydney Smith</i>, forming Nos. 61. and 62. of Longman's <i>Traveller's

  and Taste.&mdash;<i>Critical and Historical Essays, &amp;c.</i>, by the
  Right Honourable T. B. Macaulay, <i>People's</i> Edition, Part III.,
  includes his Essays on Lord Mahon's War of Succession, Walpole's Letters,
  Lord Chatham, Mackintosh's History of the Revolution, and Lord
  Bacon.&mdash;<i>Annotated Edition of the English Poets</i>, edited by
  Robert Bell. This month's issue consists of the second volume of the
  <i>Poetical Works of William Cowper</i>.</p>
